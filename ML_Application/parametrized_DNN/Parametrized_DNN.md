# Paraemtrized DNN on the v2 HiggsDNA files
for the DNN training we were training seperately for each mass points. For the parametrized DNN, we will provide weights as well for the sample training. We divided the mass point ijnto different ranges based on its kinematics. 
With parametrized DNN, where we will provides weights into the model during the traning and we will be able to do the training for all sample in once.
